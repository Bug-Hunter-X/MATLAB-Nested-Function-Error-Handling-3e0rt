This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to error handling within nested functions.  The `bug.m` file contains code that improperly uses the `error()` function, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or termination, depending on the context. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and clearer communication. The issue is subtle and might not be immediately apparent to those unfamiliar with the intricacies of MATLAB's function handling.
